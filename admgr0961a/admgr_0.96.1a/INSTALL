PHP Ad Manager Installation Instructions

Requirements

* PHP 4.0 or higher (http://www.php.net)

* MySQL (http://www.mysql.com)


Installation

These instructions will be expanded sometime in the future, but for now...

1. Unpack the distribution in a path accessible by your webserver.  (This path
   should be restricted from outside users via a password or an deny/allow from.)

2. Create 'ads' database (call it what you want, but be sure to change the config
   item accordingly.

3. Import the table structures

    mysql ads < ads.struct

4. Review 'ads.cfg' and make any necessary changes

5. Change the path information at the beginning of 'adredir.ph' to point to the
   path where you unpacked the distribution and copy that file to a publicly
   accessible directory on your website.

6. Add the following lines to your php web page(s):

   include "/path/to/ads.lib";
   showad();

6a. You can specify what ad class to display by including it as a parameter to
    the showad() function.

    showad('468x60');

7. Fire up your web browser and go to the restricted area and start adding your
   advertisement items.


Notes

This distribution uses .ph file extensions for the PHP code.  I will probably end
up renaming everything to .php in the future for compatibilty issues, but for now
you have to make sure that your webserver recognizes .ph files as being PHP code.
